# Academic Research Prompts

This file contains academic research prompts adapted from Kee-Man Chuah's article ["10 Powerful Gemini Prompts for Academic Research"](https://chuahkeeman.substack.com/p/10-powerful-gemini-prompts-for-academic).

## 1. Intellectual Lineage Prompt
**Description**: Traces the intellectual history of an academic concept, identifying origins, adaptations, and critiques.

**Prompt**:
~~~
Trace the intellectual lineage of the academic concept of [e.g., 'biopower']. Identify its origins in the work of Michel Foucault, explain its core components, chart its subsequent adoption and adaptation in fields like [e.g., public health and surveillance studies], and summarise the primary critiques levelled against it by contemporary scholars.
~~~

## 2. Positional Mapping Prompt
**Description**: Maps a thesis onto the current scholarly landscape to identify alignments, challenges, and refinements.

**Prompt**:
~~~
My central thesis is: [e.g., 'that late-Victorian anxieties about entropy were a direct driver of modernist literary fragmentation']. Map this thesis onto the current scholarly landscape. Identify which specific scholars or schools of thought I am aligning with, which I am directly challenging, and whose work I am significantly extending or refining.
~~~

## 3. Theoretical Framework Synthesis Prompt
**Description**: Synthesizes concepts from two distinct fields to propose a new hybrid theoretical framework.

**Prompt**:
~~~
Propose a theoretical framework for analysing [your research object, e.g., 'the gig economy'] by synthesising concepts from two distinct fields: [e.g., Karl Polanyi's concept of 'double movement'] and [e.g., actor-network theory]. Explain how these concepts can be integrated and what new analytical purchase this hybrid framework would offer over using either theory alone.
~~~

## 4. Concept Operationalisation Prompt
**Description**: Translates complex academic terms into observable and measurable variables for research design.

**Prompt**:
~~~
Take the complex academic term [e.g., 'institutional isomorphism']. Provide three distinct scholarly definitions. For a research project aiming to measure its presence in [e.g., the university sector in Southeast Asia], select the most suitable definition and propose a clear strategy for operationalising it into observable and measurable variables.
~~~

## 5. Methodological Defence Prompt
**Description**: Provides a robust justification for a chosen methodology while pre-emptively addressing alternatives.

**Prompt**:
~~~
I have chosen to use [e.g., a comparative historical analysis] for my study of [e.g., 'the development of property rights in two post-colonial nations']. Write a robust justification for this methodological choice, pre-emptively addressing why alternatives like [e.g., a quantitative statistical analysis or an ethnographic approach] would be less appropriate for answering my specific research question.
~~~

## 6. Ethical Review Simulation Prompt
**Description**: Simulates a university ethics review board to identify challenges and propose mitigation protocols.

**Prompt**:
~~~
My research involves [e.g., online ethnography of a closed social media group for political activists]. Acting as a university ethics review board, identify the primary ethical challenges I will face. Focus on issues of informed consent, researcher positionality, data security, and the potential for harm to participants. For each challenge, propose a specific, practical protocol to mitigate the risk.
~~~

## 7. Qualitative Thematic Coder Prompt
**Description**: Performs inductive thematic analysis on interview transcripts based on grounded theory.

**Prompt**:
~~~
Below is a raw transcript from a semi-structured interview. Based on grounded theory, perform an initial inductive thematic analysis. Read the text and identify emergent codes and patterns. Group these codes into 3-5 potential overarching themes, providing a descriptive name for each theme and citing 2-3 supporting quotes from the text. [Paste transcript snippet here]
~~~

## 8. Abstract Refinement Prompt
**Description**: Refines draft abstracts for specific journal submissions, ensuring proper structure and impact.

**Prompt**:
~~~
Refine the following draft abstract for a submission to the journal [e.g., Nature or The English Historical Review]. Ensure it follows the expected structure (Background, Aims, Methods, Results, Conclusion). Sharpen the language for maximum clarity and impact within a 250-word limit, and make certain that the 'original contribution to knowledge' is stated explicitly and powerfully in the final sentence. [Paste your draft abstract here]
~~~

## 9. Counter-Argument Generator Prompt
**Description**: Generates intellectually credible counter-arguments to strengthen a thesis.

**Prompt**:
~~~
My central argument is that [state your argument clearly]. Generate the three strongest and most intellectually credible counter-arguments to this thesis. Do not create straw men; formulate objections that a respected scholar in my field might genuinely raise. For each counter-argument, briefly explain its logical foundation.
~~~

## 10. Literature Review Architect Prompt
**Description**: Structures a literature review into an analytical and persuasive argument rather than just a list.

**Prompt**:
~~~
My research aims to answer the question: [State your specific research question]. I need to construct a literature review that doesn't just list what has been written, but builds a compelling intellectual case for my project. Please cite all verified sources and include a reference list [Attached current written review].

Your task is to architect this review by:
1. Identifying 3-4 distinct thematic sections that the literature can be organised into. These should not be simple topics, but rather stages in an argument (e.g., 'The Foundational Debate on X', 'The Methodological Shift Towards Y', 'The Emergence of Z Anomaly', 'Gaps and Unresolved Tensions').
2. Formulating a 'topic sentence' for each section that makes a clear claim about the state of the literature in that area (e.g., "While early scholarship focused primarily on the economic drivers of X, a subsequent 'cultural turn' has complicated this narrative by...").
3. Proposing a 'golden thread' or narrative arc that connects these sections, ensuring the review flows logically from a broad discussion towards the specific gap your research will fill.
4. Suggesting key transitional phrases to link the final section to my proposed research, making my project seem like the necessary next step in the scholarly conversation.
